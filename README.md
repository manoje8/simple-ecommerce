# Simple ECommerce

This is a simple full-stack ECommerce landing page built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The app allows users to browse products, search by product name, filter by category, and view product details in a modal. The UI is responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across devices.

## Features

- **Product Display:** Products are fetched from the backend and displayed in a responsive grid.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search products by name.
- **Category Filters:** Products can be filtered by category (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Home Appliances).
- **Product Modal:** Clicking on a product opens a modal with detailed information.
